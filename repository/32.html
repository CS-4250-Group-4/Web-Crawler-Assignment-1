<h2>Special Safeguards for Facilities or Activities</h2>
<h3>Security of and Access to Campus Facilities</h3>
<p>UPD is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment, and for the protection of all on campus properties and facilities owned, operated, controlled, or administered by the University. UPD is responsible for controlling access to all University facilities and may revoke access per Penal Code section 626. To provide for the security of campus facilities, UPD enforces Educational Code section 89031 and campus Housing Policies. Most campus buildings and facilities are open to the campus community and the public during the day and evening hours when classes are in session. &#160;When the University is officially closed (e.g., observed holidays), buildings are locked and may only be accessed by faculty, staff, and students with proper authorization. All campus facilities have key and/or security card access. Facilities Management is responsible for key control and distribution. The Division of Information Technology (IT) manages alarm and card access control. Access to on-campus student housing facilities is restricted to residents, their approved/escorted guests and other approved campus community members. Housing security includes both key entry and card access. Housing manages the card access programs for student residence facilities, except for Sicomora Hall and Secoya Hall which utilize Bronco Cards and are managed by IT.</p>
<p>Note: Access to campus and campus facilities may be limited and/or require additional procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cal Poly Pomona campus remains open. All offices are open during regular business hours with most continuing to offer virtual/remote services as well. Before you come to campus, please be sure to complete the 3-step checklist: training, health screener and what you should do when you are on campus. Information for our community may be found on-line at <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/safer-return/index.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/safety/safer-return/index.shtml, </a>including checklist items required and the campus health and safety plan.</p>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona utilizes video security cameras to deter crime, assist in identifying and investigating crime, and to aid in the apprehension and prosecution of offenders. Video cameras are located <a name="_Toc399795046"></a>throughout the campus and may be monitored by UPD or accessed for real-time use.</p>
<h3>Security Considerations Used in Maintenance of Campus Facilities</h3>
<p>Security considerations are a priority in the maintenance of campus facilities. Campus facilities and grounds are designed and maintained to promote safety and prevent crime, and are inspected on a regular basis. Grounds staff keep vegetation controlled around lighting and along campus walkways and roadways on a regular schedule. UPD Student Assistants conduct Code Blue Phone checks once per semester. UPD also conducts preventative maintenance on the campus alarm and access system. Concepts of crime prevention through environmental design are considered for new construction, planning and improvements on campus.</p>
<p>Facilities Management will respond to reports of potential safety and security hazards (e.g., broken windows, inoperable locks, lighting problems, downed trees/tree limbs). To report a potential hazard, contact Facilities Management during business hours at (909) 869-3030. After hours, contact UPD at (909) 869-3070.</p>
<h3>Fire Safety</h3>
<p>Most campus buildings, including student residential facilities, are protected by fire sprinklers and/or smoke and heat alarm systems. Facilities Management has a preventative maintenance program that includes fire alarm and system testing. Foundation and ASI buildings are also tested by contracted vendors. The Annual Fire Safety Report provides information regarding fire safety, fire safety systems and fire statistics in student residence facilities. The report may be accessed on-line at <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/housing/documents/fire_safety_report.pdf">https://www.cpp.edu/housing/documents/fire_safety_report.pdf</a>&#160; Student residents receive fire safety and evacuation information as part of their move-in process.</p>
<p>Evacuation drills are conducted annually involving all University Housing Services and Foundation Housing Services/University Village (Housing). All Housing professional staff and student resident and community advisors receive training in evacuation policies and procedures. An annual mock evacuation drill is conducted with all Housing staff. An annual campus evacuation drill is scheduled in coordination with the Great California Shakeout. &#160;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Special Event Safety Planning</h2>
<p>Preparation for large campus events typically involves the creation of Incident Action Plans according to the Standardized Emergency Management system and in collaboration with mutual aid agencies and contracted safety personnel. In alignment with county, state and CSU requirements and recommendations related to COVID-19, the campus best practices guidelines offer a baseline for safety when conducting any event or gathering in person, on or off campus. Event planners can require additional safety procedures at their events to better match the event location. &#160;The guidelines may be found on-line at <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safer-return/events.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/safer-return/events.shtml</a></p>
<h2>Actions in the Last 18 Months to Increase Safety</h2>

<li>Enhance the BSC Emergency Response Plan: All ASI/BSC staff to be certified in Basic CPR/AED/First Aid and BSC Operations staff to be certified in advanced CPR/AED/First Aid and Emergency O2.</li>
<li>Revise Lost Minor protocol for the BSC and BRIC.</li>
<li>Install safety equipment for the BSC: Emergency generator and battery back-up, additional AEDs for Games Room, and response kits with emergency O2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Records of On-Campus Crime</h2>
<p>California Education Code 67380(a)(1)(A)</p>
<p>California State University campuses are required by California Education Code 67380(a)(1)(A) to compile records of all occurrences reported to campus police, campus security personnel, or campus safety authorities of, and arrests for, crimes that are committed on campus and that involve violence, hate violence, theft, destruction of property, illegal drugs, or alcohol intoxication and to make this information available within two business days if requested by students, prospective students, employees, or the media. If you wish to request crime information, please contact <a href="mailto:clery@cpp.edu">clery@cpp.edu</a></p>
