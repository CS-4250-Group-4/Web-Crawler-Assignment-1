                                                <p><strong>Who is required to test?</strong></p>
<p>Weekly public health testing is required for all students and employees who come to campus or attend in-person university activities. Individuals who have verified their vaccination in <a href="https://myhealthportal.cpp.edu/">MyHealthPortal</a> are exempt, unless otherwise required by CPP policy, local, state or federal health authorities.</p>
<p>Required to test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who have not uploaded a vaccination record and not received notice of verification in <a href="https://myhealthportal.cpp.edu/">MyHealthPortal</a></li>
<li>Individuals who have requested a medical or religious exemption to vaccination&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do I have to show proof of a negative test before going to class or accessing campus facilities?</strong></p>
<p>The testing program is not a gatekeeping mechanism &#8211; you are not required to show proof of a negative test to attend class or access campus facilities. The testing program is used to detect and monitor potential cases and minimize outbreaks.</p>
<p>However, if you feel sick or experience COVID-like symptoms, do not go to campus. Instead, report your symptoms via the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safer-return/checklist/prior-to-campus.shtml">online Health Screener</a> and a member of the campus&#8217; Incident Investigation Team will follow up with you.&#160;</p>
<p>If you receive a positive test result, do not go to campus. Either Student Health or a member of the campus&#8217; Incident Investigation Team will follow up with you on next steps.</p>
<p><strong>Is there an exemption to the weekly public health testing?</strong></p>
<p>Weekly public health testing is required for students and employees (state and auxiliary) who come to campus or participate in in-person university activities. Only individuals who have verified their vaccination will be exempt.</p>
<p><strong>If I&#8217;m not going to be on campus this week, do I have to test?</strong></p>
<p>Testing is required for the week if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to campus for any amount of time</li>
<li>Accessing campus facilities, such as the BRIC, Bookstore, Library, SSB, CenterPointe Dining, classroom, office, laboratory</li>
<li>Going to in-person internship or co-op that is sponsored by the university, either on-campus or off-campus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m feeling sick. Should I go to campus for testing?</strong></p>
<p>If you experience any of the symptoms below, do not come to campus. Instead, report your symptoms via the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safer-return/checklist/prior-to-campus.shtml">online Health Screener</a> and a member of the campus&#8217; Incident Investigation Team will follow up with you. Do not participate in the public health testing program, unless otherwise instructed.</p>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, do not come to campus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever (at or over 100.4 F or 38 C)</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
<li>Muscle aches or body aches</li>
<li>Vomiting or diarrhea</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the campus&#8217; public health testing program is not to diagnose COVID-19 infection for individuals who experience symptoms. Instead, it is used to detect and monitor potential cases and potential outbreaks on campuses, especially among people who do not show symptoms.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong>I am experiencing COVID-like symptoms. Where can I get tested? </strong></p>
<p>For students, contact <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/health/contact-us.shtml">Student Health</a> and you will be advised of next steps.</p>
<p>For employees, seek care from your primary health care provider. Call in advance before going to the facility.</p>
<p><strong>I am fully vaccinated and would like to be tested. Can I make an appointment for a campus test?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. the Public Health Testing site does allow voluntary testing for students and employees. Availability of appointments and walk-ins may be limited because the testing site primarily serves individuals who are required to test. Go to&#160;<a href="https://myhealthportal.cpp.edu">MyHealthPortal</a> to make an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Can I meet the weekly testing requirement with a test from off-campus?</strong></p>
<p>No. If you are required to participate in weekly public health testing at Cal Poly Pomona, you must schedule an appointment with the campus testing site. We are not able to confirm testing results at other locations.</p>
<p><strong>If I&#8217;ve tested positive for COVID-19, when should I test again?</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tested positive for COVID-19 at the campus Public Health Testing Site, you should wait 90 days before taking another PCR test on campus. If you need to re-test to end your isolation period earlier than 10 days, you should take a rapid antigen test.&#160;&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Students</strong> can make an appointment with <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/health/student-health-services.shtml">Student Health</a> [link to website] to get a rapid test. If it&#8217;s negative, you may be able to end your isolation time early and return to normal activities.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Employees</strong> should find a rapid antigen test if you want to end your isolation period sooner than 10 days. These tests are sold at many pharmacies and retailers, and the federal government is providing <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.covidtests.gov%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmmquiroz%40cpp.edu%7C641808ce34354f8b714a08d9f19395b1%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C637806438452307447%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=U2eJ4%2BYjgszE3ShzKdIU9ZaGy9%2FkvEr7mwWUy%2B44DA8%3D&amp;reserved=0">four at-home kits</a> to every household at no charge.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get a negative test result from the self/at-home/off-campus tests, you must take a photo and email it to the incident investigators at <a href="mailto:healthscreener@cpp.edu">healthscreener@cpp.edu</a>. Only after the result is confirmed, you may be cleared to resume your normal activities on campus.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the testing location?</strong></p>
<p>The testing program will be held at the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/maps/?id=1130#!m/282698">CLA Paseo</a>, which is located between the CLA Tower and Voorhis Park. It is a covered outdoor area with privacy fencing. Signs will identify the site as &#8220;Public Health Testing.&#8221; The main entrance to the testing site is on the north side by the Rose Garden.</p>
<p><strong>What are the hours of the testing site?</strong></p>
<p>The testing site will be open Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. (first appointment) to 4:30 p.m. (last appointment). The site is closed on weekends.</p>
<p><strong>Is there parking near the testing location?</strong></p>
<p>There is nearby parking in Parking Structure 1 and the F lots. The Bronco Express Shuttle&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/transportation/commuting-to-campus/bronco-shuttle.shtml">Main Campus Route</a> stops near the CLA Paseo. The testing site does not have dedicated parking and does not offer drive-thru services.</p>
<p><strong>How long does the appointment take?</strong></p>
<p>Plan for 15 minutes for the entire testing process, including check-in and checkout. The actual saliva test should take no more than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The university has contracted with SheildT3 to provide saliva-based tests that are processed via a qPCR process, which produces fast and accurate results.</p>
<p><strong>How should I prepare for my test?</strong></p>
<p>When you come for your appointment, be prepared to show the QR code that you received upon scheduling your appointment. <strong>For ideal test results, do not brush teeth, smoke/vape, eat, or drink liquids 30 to 60 minutes before your appointment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can my family test at the campus&#8217; Public Health Testing Site?&#160;</strong></p>
<p>No, unless they are current students or employees. Cal Poly Pomona&#8217;s Public Health Testing Site is only open to students and employees for required and voluntary testing. It is not set up to handle electronic medical records for members of the public. Family members and household members of students and employees are not able to test on campus.</p>

                                                <p><strong>How do I make an appointment?</strong></p>
<p>Each week, usually Sunday night or Monday morning, you will receive an email that prompts you to schedule an appointment via <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safer-return/vaccine-upload.shtml">MyHealthPortal</a>. Follow the instructions to make an appointment for the week (Monday through Friday).</p>
<p><strong>Are walk-in appointments allowed?</strong></p>
<p>Walk-in appointments will be accepted, although individuals with appointments will receive priority. If the testing site is over capacity, you may be asked to return at a different time and day.</p>
<p><strong>I missed my appointment this week. What do I do? </strong></p>
<p>If you missed your appointment, go online and schedule another appointment. Or, you may go to the testing site and walk-in for the test. Individuals with appointments will receive priority. If the testing site is over capacity, you may be asked to return at a different time and day.</p>
<p><strong>I forgot to schedule an appointment this week. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>You have an entire week (Monday through Friday) to be tested. If you forgot to schedule your appointment, go online and schedule another appointment. Or, you may go to the testing site and walk-in for the test. Individuals with appointments will receive priority. If the testing site is over capacity, you may be asked to return at a different time and day.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to keep the same appointment each week? Can I schedule my appointments for the entire semester?</strong></p>
<p>Appointments are scheduled a week at a time. You will receive an email on Sunday night or Monday morning that prompts you to schedule your appointment for that week (Monday through Friday). At this time, the system does allow people to schedule appointments weeks in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to schedule a test before going to my on-campus class?</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily. You have an entire week to complete your test, and you&#8217;re not required to test before attending in-person activities. For scheduling purposes, the week begins Sunday and ends Saturday, and testing is available Monday through Friday. &#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>EX: If you plan to be on campus on a Sunday, you can schedule a testing appointment anytime in the next five days (Monday through Friday).</li>
<li>EX: If you plan to be on campus Monday and Wednesday for class, you have until Friday of that week to test. You&#8217;re not required to schedule the appointment on Monday before attending class.</li>
<li>EX: If you plan to be on campus on Saturday only, you must come to campus during the week (preceding Monday through Friday) for your test.</li>
