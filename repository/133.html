<p><strong>How does this affect me?</strong> Ongoing fires in Southern California may affect air quality. South Coast AQMD tracks the current air quality on its website and&#160;<a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airnow.gov%2F%3Fcity%3DPomona%26state%3DCA%26country%3DUSA&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cgcfong%40cpp.edu%7Cb8ef3862b9614064414908d9697c4421%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C637656804696146455%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=GO3b19t61xPp32bsUHw%2BFVjbDMilkP8cYDLh8BtkM10%3D&amp;reserved=0">AirNow</a>&#160;website.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do? </strong>If you are unusually sensitive to particle pollution, consider reducing your activity level or shorten the amount of time you are active outdoors.&#160; Employees who may be working outdoors should contact their HEERA manager for any questions or concerns about their outdoor activity. Further instructions may be provided by your manager as needed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wearing a KN-95 mask or the equivalent outdoors may help for individuals who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. Replace when masks are dirty, damaged, or soiled.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary of Disruption:</strong> The City of Pomona has undertaken a Major Street Rehabilitation project on Valley Boulevard. The project affects the campus boundaries on Valley Boulevard from Temple Avenue to State Route 71 Freeway. The work will be performed weekdays from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. The project started on March 1 and is expected to be completed by the end of October. Access entering or exiting Temple Avenue and Kellogg Drive may be limited while the paving operation is taking place.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Disruption:</strong> Major street rehabilitation along Valley Boulevard is required to repair potholes, improve pavement, and accommodate new protected bike lanes on the east side of Valley Boulevard. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>How does this affect me?</strong> Two-way traffic will be maintained during construction, but there will be brief delays and partial lane closures along Valley Boulevard. The sidewalk along Valley Boulevard also may be temporarily closed. No Parking signs will be posted 48 hours prior to start of work on the west side of Valley Boulevard.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong>&#160;Proceed with caution when approaching work zones. Avoid parking on Valley Boulevard where signs are posted. Please share this information with others who may have not received this message.</p>

                                                <p>In order for Cal Poly Pomona to meet the high-tech needs of future generations of students, the university is going old-school.</p>
<p>Time-tested machines and tools such as backhoes, pneumatic drills and shovels will puncture concrete and asphalt and excavate soil so contractor crews can install a state-of-the art electrical distribution network that will provide reliability and a redundancy system to prevent outages. The campus electrical distribution system is reaching the end of its lifecycle.</p>
<p>To accomplish this unprecedented feat, the university launched the Electrical Infrastructure Upgrade (EIU) project in late June 2020 that will accommodate technological innovations of the coming decades. Facilities Planning and Management (FP&amp;M) is overseeing every aspect of the massive project, which ensures that the electrical needs of the university will be addressed for the next 60 years while also meeting current electrical code requirements.</p>
